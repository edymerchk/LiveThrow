#Live Throw
========

Live Throw is the final project for the _Special Topics in Telematics_ course; the idea behind this project is a open-source web app where you can keep track of statistics, real-time updates/score and community collaboration, all around Ultimate Frisbee games.

All written in Node.js with the fantastic and beautiful _little language_ CoffeeScript.

###Context

>Ultimate is a sport played with a flying disc. The object of the game is to score points by passing the disc to a player in the opposing end zone, similar to an end zone in American football or rugby. Players may not run with the disc, and may only move one foot (pivot) while holding the disc.
